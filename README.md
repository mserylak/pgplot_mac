# pgplot_mac

This repository comprises all the files that are modified or added in order for the
PGPLOT library to compile on macOS Big Sur 11.1.

In order to build it successfully you need to follow most of the recommendations from
original PGPLOT page (https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot) and standard required
libraries installed using Homebrew (GNU gcc, libpng etc.).
